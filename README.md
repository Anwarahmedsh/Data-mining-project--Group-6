Since breast cancer affects women regardless of age or ethnicity and is the most common invasive cancer in women around the world, we have chosen to focus on this dataset.
In our project, we will research and analyze patients data that will be helpful in identifying potential risks and factors that may lead to breast cancer, as well as discuss the survival rate. By doing this, we can increase awareness of the disease and encourage many women to take preventative measures by estimating their likelihood of developing breast cancer based on certain risk factors.
